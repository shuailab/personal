Shuaiâ€™s research is driven by challenging data analytics problems, emphasizes innovation in machine learning and data analytics in connected world, automates the integration of human with these data-driven learning systems, and targets system-level interpretable and explainable decision-makings. 

He develops methodologies for modeling, monitoring, diagnosis, and prognosis of complex networked systems, such as brain connectivity networks, social networks, cyber-physics systems, and Internet of Things (IoT). 

He also develops novel AI and machine learning models to integrate the massive heterogeneous datasets such as neuroimaging, genomics, proteomics, laboratory tests, demographics, and clinical variables, for facilitating scientific discoveries in biomedical research and better decision making in clinical practices. 

Working with domain experts, these data-driven learning, data engineering, and decision-making models are applied to a range of applications such as healthcare (precision medicine, disease research, biomarker discovery), neuroscience, system biology, IoT, and transportation (mobility data analysis, user behavior modeling for smart transportation demand management (TDM)).
