Shuaiâ€™s research is driven by challenging data analytics and AI problems, emphasizes innovation in machine learning and AI modeling for [complex systems and processes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053811909014281) in the [connected world](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8169076), automates the [integration of human](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8304661) with these data-driven learning systems, and targets [interpretable and explainable](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1532046421000204) decision-makings with discretion of [AI ethics and accountability](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9115837). 

He develops methodologies for modeling, monitoring, diagnosis, and prognosis of [complex networked systems](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/24725854.2017.1301692), such as brain connectivity networks, manufacturing processes, enterprise systems, cyber-physics systems, and Internet of Things (IoT). 

He also develops novel AI and machine learning models to integrate the massive heterogeneous datasets such as neuroimaging, genomics, proteomics, laboratory tests, demographics, and clinical variables, for facilitating scientific [discoveries](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8888210) in biomedical research and better [decision making](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9413157) in clinical practices. 

Working with domain experts, these data-driven learning, data engineering, and decision-making models are applied to a range of applications such as healthcare ([precision medicine](https://www.mpowercare.org), [disease research](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41666-020-00085-1), [biomarker discovery](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/24725579.2018.1496494)), neuroscience, system biology, [IoT](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v108/huo20a.html), monitoring and anomaly detection, and [transportation](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9292970) ([mobility data analysis](https://sites.uw.edu/bigdata4mobility/), [user behavior modeling](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0968090X20307191) for smart transportation demand management (TDM)).
